# PROBLEM/CHALLENGE
Asteroids pose a threat to Earth. While most asteroids orbit safely, some come close enough to be consid-
ered potentially hazardous and could cause significant damage if they were to impact Earth. Predicting
which asteroids are hazardous allows space agencies to prioritize observation on certain asteroids, de-
velop mitigation strategies, and design early-warning systems. The classification of asteroids is difficult
and time-consuming work, requiring analysis of a large variety of aspects about a given asteroid. As
such, a model capable of predicting such data would be a great one.

# APPROACH

We will be using a tree-based ensemble method, this approach uses ideas
from class such as supervised learning, classification, model training, and evaluation. We will build
4
a system that cleans and preprocesses the asteroid dataset, selects and engineers relevant features, and
trains a model using machine learning to classify asteroids as potentially hazardous or not. We will
handle class imbalance using techniques like oversampling( e.g., SMOTE)), or weighted loss, and then
evaluate the model.
